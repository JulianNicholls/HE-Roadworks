## Git client

I have used Git at the command-line for 10 years. Over that time, I have tried
many different graphical shells for Git, without finding one that was easier
and nicer to use than the command-line (in my view).

I have now found that [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) is an excellent
Git shell and would advise using it to everyone.
